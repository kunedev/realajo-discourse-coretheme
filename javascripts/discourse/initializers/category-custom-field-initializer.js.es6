      NOTE, the registerConnectorClass is deprecated.   I am leaving the commented-out code here in the plugin for reference for now. 
      I am going to replace these calls within the Realajo Core Theme, not within this plugin. 
      That is going to mean hard-coding the name as rtopicinfo but that is OK because all of the usage will be hard-coded anyway.

          const category = attrs.category;

          // The category model does not include a custom_fields object by 
          // default, so we need to make sure it exists before proceeding as
          // that is what we'll be using to ensure our attribute is serialized
          // to the server and updated (see also onChangeField below).
          if (!category.custom_fields) {
            category.custom_fields = {};
